# hello-world
My name is Eugene and I went into coding to create a great things.
My hobbies are: IT, crypto (including trading), blockchain tech, WEB (particulary 3.0), futurology... and many other things that appearing so fast in modern life.
I'm attracting with MMA and Cybersports, experimental electronic and techno music, and clubbing sometimes.
Also I'm interested in esoterics and psychedelic expieriences, but currently it is irregular and a bit small part of my life.
I'm an emphatic introvert, but I always happy to meet, converse and deal with like-minded persons. In people I appreciate qualities like: fairness, heartness, singleness and personality.

Now working as engineer-technologist in electronics instrumentation for last 5 years, and my main purpose is switching into WEB and software engineering to realise my own ideas, and of course... <b>to make the world better!</b>
